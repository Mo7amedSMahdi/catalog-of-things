# Catalog of my things

In this project, We create a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below.

The data will be stored in JSON files but we also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to the program's class structure.
